# Minimal example of problem

Example of problem with the GCP library for Discovery Engine, and Vertex Search. This example should yield some sort of authentication error, but instead I only ever get `java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/google/cloud/discoveryengine/v1/SearchServiceSettings` - I am probably making some mistake in building this or importing the relevant Java libraries but I fail to find it.

Access on [http://localhost:8080/_/service/vertex/vertexSearch] after running the code in any XP sandbox.
